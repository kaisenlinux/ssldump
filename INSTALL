If you don't have libpcap, you'll need to get it and install it. You
can obtain it from:
	http://www.tcpdump.org/

If you want to be able to decrypt SSL traffic or view certificates,
get OpenSSL if you don't have it:
	http://www.openssl.org/

Once you've built and installed libpcap and OpenSSL, you're ready to
build ssldump.

ssldump uses a GNU autoconf-based configuration to automatically
configure the build. 

In the simplest form you can simply do:
	./configure

If the configure script can't find libpcap, it will abort. If you've
installed it in unobvious place, you may need to give configure a hint 
using the '--with-pcap' or '--with-pcap-{lib,inc}' switches.

If the configure script can't find OpenSSL, it will continue without
it. If your OpenSSL is in a nonstandard location, you may need to give 
configure a hint with the '--with-openssl' or
'--with-openssl-{lib,include}' switches.

Once you've done the configure, you can simply run 'make'. Note that
on some platforms (HP/UX) you will have to use GNU make (gmake).

If the make succeeds, run a 'make install' (you will probably need to
be root to do this.)

If you get ssldump to work on a platform not listed above, please send mail
to ssldump@rtfm.com with the platform and any fixes you had to make.
